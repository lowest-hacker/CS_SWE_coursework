# Description:Write a class called Person that has two private data members - the person's name and age.
# It should have an init method that takes two values and uses them to initialize the data members.
# It should have a get_age method.


# Write a separate function (not part of the Person class) called std_dev that takes as a parameter
# a list of Person objects and returns the standard deviation of all their ages
# (the population standard deviation that uses a denominator of N, not the sample standard deviation,
# which uses a different denominator).


# To calculate the standard deviation, you'll need to take a square root, which you can do by just using an
# exponent of 0.5. For example, the result of 9 ** 0.5 would be 3.0. Python does have a specific sqrt() function,
# but that involves importing a module, which we haven't covered yet.

"""setting up the class defined as Person with the initial function to grab the name and age of the person"""
"""The following are the necessary steps for calculating the standard deviation:
Step 1: Find the mean
Step 2: Find each scoreâ€™s deviation from the mean
Step 3: Square each deviation from the mean
Step 4: Find the sum of squares
Step 5: Find the variance
Step 6: Find the square root of the variance
